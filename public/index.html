                The following chart and table provide rough estimates for current expected attack costs and revenues.
                Estimates are derived from the configurable values below, along with a constant block time.
                <!--            Hashrate is not required in calculating the table's values.-->
                The <code>Net with MESS (USD)</code> column can be understood as a minimum payout
                from fraud that the attacker would need to break even given the cost of the attack.

            <h3 id="section-what-a-51-percent-attack-is">What a 51-percent attack is</h3>

            <p>
                A “51% attack” is a scheme in which an “attacker” commits fraud against some victim, with the attacker
                renegging on their side of some transaction after receiving a counterparty’s corresponding payment.</p>
            <p>
                They do this by secretly mining a chain which critically omits the depositing transaction to the
                counterparty. Once the attacker receives the victim’s side of the exchange (which was predicated on the
                attacker’s deposit), the attacker publishes their chain, invalidating their end of the bargain.</p>
            <p>
                History is rewritten, and the attacker has received something for nothing, less the cost of carrying out
                the
                scheme.</p>

            <h3 id="section-hashing-availability">Hashing Availability (and Cost)</h3>

            <p>
                In order for an attacker to mount an attack, they must have the capital necessary to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                While a theoretical cost can be derived for arbitrary hash rates,
                actual material resource availability is both extremely difficult to estimate,
                and a very important limitation for the attack strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hashrate cost is a function of (at least) the hardware itself and the cost of running the hardware, ie.
                electricity.
            </p>

            <h4 id="section-etc-daggerhashimoto-etchash">Mining Algorithm</h4>
            <p>
                The original mining algorithm <i>Dagger-Hashimoto</i> (aka <code>ethash</code>)
                has been changed to <code>etchash</code> on Ethereum Classic.
            </p>
            <p>
                At block 11_700_000 (2020 November 28), Ethereum Classic implemented <a
                    href="https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1099.md/">ECIP-1099</a>,
                extending the Hashimoto DAG epoch length by a factor of 2, and thus lowering the requirement for mining
                hardware memory allocation, which had recently exceeded 4GB.
            </p>
            <p>
                This change was and is expected to recover and increase hardware availability for the mining algorithm.
                Greater hardware availability should lead to greater network hashrate.
                <!--            Although not necessarily linearly across the competing hashrate markets.-->
            </p>
            <p>
                It also had the side-effect of removing the Ethereum Classic mining protocol from defaults provided by
                on-demand hashrate marketplaces, notably <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/">Nicehash.com</a>.

                The hardware available for mining on ETC is now a <em>superset</em> of the hardware capable of mining
                ETH.
                This means that the current hashrate on ETH should be considered as a representative minimum of
                potentially
                applicable hardware to ETC.

                An emphasis on the technological (eg. hardware) limitations for a network's relative hashrate,
                determined by its Proof of Work algorithm, is worth repeating.
                For example, the hashrate on Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of writing is
                206_853 Ph/s <sup><a href="https://whattomine.com/coins/1-btc-sha-256">WhatToMine</a></sup>.
                However, much of the specialized hardware in use for this application is inapplicable to the Ethash
                algorithm.

            <p>
                MESS stands for “Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring.” MESS is a protocol strategy <a
                    href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/">originally
                    proposed by
                    Vitalik Buterin</a> and modified (slightly) by me, Isaac Ardis. Its specification can be found at <a
                    href="https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/blob/master/_specs/ecip-1100.md">ECIP-1100</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                MESS was developed and implemented in reaction to a series of three 51-percent attacks occurring on ETC
                in
                August 2020 worth around 5 million USD.
                At this time, the hashrate on ETC was around 5 Th/s, and the exchange rate was around $7 USD/ETC.
                The attacker's hashrate was apparently acquired via Nicehash.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                MESS increases the cost of producing a competitive chain by opinionating the network clients toward
                their
                incumbent chain (weak subjectivity), at a rate (pseudo-exponentially) proportional to the length of the
                competitive chain segment.
                Because of an increased cost of producing a competitive chain, finality expectations for the honest
                public
                network
                rise.

                (<code>f(0)=1</code>), and a maximum value of 31 (<code>f(25132)=31</code>).

                    Having a cap at 32x or some value in that ballpark seems totally reasonable; you're right that

                Network-wide Sybil Attack</h5>
            One participant in the discussion of MESS raised a concern as follows:
            <p>
                <blockquote>
                    Your new solution improves the protection but still allows a different selfish mining attack. It
                    requires
                    more hashrate and very high network connectivity.
                    <br><br>
                    This is the attack:
                    <br><br>
                    We assume the attacker has two times (plus epsilon) the honest hashrate. Let's assume that the
                    victim is
                    waiting for C confirmations. So the attacker first starts mining a public chain A with 1-second
                    intervals
                    and with a hashrate that exceeds the honest hashrate. But he keeps mining his blocks in private. If
                    the
                    honest miners create a block on top of A, then the attacker releases immediately one of his private
                    blocks
                    so that nodes see the attacker block before the honest block, and therefore all the blocks in fork A
                    will be
                    generated by the attacker, and always the timestamp of the best block in A will be in the past.
                    This is a 51% attack combined by a selfish-mining attack.
                    <br><br>
                    At the same time the attacker is mining a fork B with more hashrate than A. This fork has normal
                    timestamps
                    (or past timestamps, it doesn't matter). When the fork A is C blocks in length (and the victim has
                    already
                    confirmed the double-spent transaction) he leaves fork A and reveals fork B. Nodes will apply a very
                    low
                    penalty on B because the best block in A has a timestamp that is 10 times closer to the common
                    ancestor than
                    what is expected.
                    <br><br>
                    While this attack requires much more resources (2X the hashrate and higher control over the
                    network), it's
                    still possible.
                    <br><br>
                    My proposal of the availability rule would not accept fork A as valid in the first place, and
                    therefore the
                    double-spend transaction will never be confirmed in fork A.

            </p>

            <p>
                A close look at the reasoning here discovers a few critical issues with the argument.
                <ul>
                    <li>If <span class="q">the attacker has two times the public hashrate (plus epsilon)</span>
                        (<code>(2*publicHashrate+e)/2</code>),
                        and must mine the public chain as well as a competitive chain simultaneously,
                        it stands to reason that their assumed hashrate will be insufficient.
                        If the attacker spends half of their available hashrate (<code>1*publicHashrate+e</code>) mining
                        the
                        public chain,
                        the resulting hashrate on the public chain will be <code>2*publicHashrate</code>,
                        while the attacker will have only <code>1*public hashrate</code> to spend building the private
                        competing
                        segment.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="q">If the honest miners create a block on top of A, then the attacker releases
                            immediately one of his
                            private blocks so that nodes see the attacker block before the honest block, and therefore
                            all the
                            blocks in fork A will be generated by the attacker.</span>
                        Here, the attacker (or the author) underestimates the cost of producing blocks sufficient to
                        suppress
                        those of the rest of the network.
                        If the attacker has <code>1*publicHashrate</code> applied to this purpose in competition with
                        the honest
                        miners,
                        together themselves representing <code>1*publicHashrate</code>,
                        the attacker's hashrate will only be able to produce a winning block 50% of the time relative to
                        the
                        honest public.
                        With that understanding, obviously the expectation for the attacker's success approaches zero,
                        since perfect success can be quantified as a sequential <code>n</code> trials with
                        <code>P(n)=0.5**n</code>
                        If the attacker is unable to provide a replacement block only <i>once</i>, the honest miners
                        will
                        insert a canonical block with a current timestamp, unraveling the strategy entirely.
                    </li>
                    <li>Generally, the feature where <span class="q">[the attacker] releases [...] one of his private
                            blocks so that nodes see the attacker block before the honest block</span>
                        would be practically extraordinarily difficult to achieve.
                        It would require a comprehensive view and control of the global, decentralized, permissionless
                        network.
                        An attack of this variety and magnitude would effectively become a network-wide <a

                        a circumstance no blockchain, real or theoretical, would be equipped to handle.

            </p>

            <h4 id="section-mess-vulnerabilities">MESS Known Vulnerabilities</h4>
            <p>Because the MESS protocol induces nodes to act decisively on an evaluation of a subjective data point
                (local
                head), network consensus is vulnerable to bifurcation under circumstances which are expected to be
                difficult to achieve (from an attacker’s persepctive: <em>costly</em>).</p>
            <p>An effort has been made to quantify the expected cost of such a vulnerability. This effort from December
                2020
                estimated the cost at around “20_000 USD upfront, and 5_000 USD per month to maintain the split.”
                <sup><a href="./MESS%20Exploit%20Details%20and%20Simulation.pdf">Veriblock v1</a></sup> At this time,
                ETC
                had a network hashrate around 5Th/s.</p>
            <p>It is my opinion on this work that the model it bases its findings on is naive and occassionally
                incorrect,
                and that its claims are underestimates (since, at least, complexity is probably expensive).</p>
            <p>Of further note is that this vulnerability is <em>a different category</em> of vulnerability than a
                51-percent attack. Where the 51-percent scheme is a scenario pitting a fraudster against one or a few
                victims, the vulnerability resulting from the mechanics of the MESS protocol is nearer in spirit to
                terrorism (or a controlled market short) since bifurcating the network would likely destroy its value.

            <!--
    For a GOOD risk analysis of fraud on ETC, there are some more important things to consider:
    - ETC transaction throughput value, the number and scale (value) of transactions per second. (ie. Volume).
    - Exchange (client) confirmation rates.
    Since the risk of fraud is borne and controlled by the client (eg. an exchange),
    the analysis needs to try to understand the outlooks of client behavior.
    We can use transaction throughput (ie. Volume) to measure how much currency is being traded,
    and thus how much is at stake (over time; as a frequency).
    The volume measurement then needs to be shared (as shares; ratios) over the clients by confirmation delay rates.

                Volume</h2>

            <p>
                Although chain state finality expectations are important in understanding finality fraud risk,
                consumer behavior and overall trading volume are equally important to understanding an overall risk
                profile;
                the risks from fraud are largely borne and managed by the consumer.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Consumer behavior</strong> is important because risk profiles considered in aggregate
                define the risk exposure for the market in general. In the context of this document,
                we 'll limit our consideration of consumers to high-profile cryptocurrency exchanges,
                expecting that they represent a sufficient heuristic for the market at large.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Transaction (trading) volume</strong> is important because it represents the value at stake for
                some
                measure of risk.
                It should be noted that in this context, "transaction volume" is not necessarily spot exchange volume,
                but the volume of transactional value moved through the network.
                Conventional trading volume, on the other hand, can be managed in proprietary escrow by exchanges at a
                layer
                above the network's.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chain state analysis shows that for the last 7 days from the time of writing,
                the ETC network had mean and median transaction values of 35 ETC and 43 ETC per transaction
                respectively,
                and a mean 8 transactions per block.

            <h3 id="derivation-of-cost-values">Derivation of Cost Values</h3>
            <p>
                Since marketplace prices for ETC-compatible hashing power have become murky with the omission of
                <code>etchash</code>
                from
                popular on-demand hashrate marketplaces, we must assume the task of building a usable estimate for
                ETC-compatible hashrate cost.
                To do so, we build from a general economic intuition that the cost of hashrate should be
                slightly (or somewhat) less than the revenue it earns.
                If the costs exceeded the revenue, miners would not be incentived to commit work to the chain. If the
                revenue dramatically exceeded the costs, hashrate would rise with increased competition for the spoils
                of
                the market inefficiency.</p>
            <p>
                Given these constraints, we provide a sort of reverse-engineered estimation of ETC’s hashing cost using
                publicly available information for ETC’s younger sister, ETH.</p>
            <p>
                We first show that a cost estimate is close to an expected potential revenue.</p>
            <p>
                If ETH’s hashrate is 929.397 TH/s and the cost of marketplace DaggerHashimoto hashrate is 0.99
                BTC/TH/24h
                and
                the ETH:BTC exchange rate is 0.07127 then the cost of marketplace DaggerHashimoto hashrate in ETH is
                <code>0.99
                    * (1/0.07127=14) = 13.9</code> ETH/TH/24h</p>
            <p>
                At these rates, the cost of an equilibrium chain would be at least matching its current hashrate at the
                current hashrate price 929.397 * 13.9 ETH/24h = 12910.1 ETH / 24h</p>
            <p>
                ETH’s block time is 13.5 seconds yielding (24<em>60</em>60 seconds / 24hr = 86400 seconds / 13.5 seconds
                =
                6400 blocks / day) ETH’s block reward is 2 ETH / block. <sup><a
                        href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/d8f963811df6ef97c76c9b4f433bf0bc936051e2/consensus/ethash/consensus.go#L44">Source</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The ETH token currency inflates at at least 6400 blocks * 2 ETH per day = 12800 ETH per day. A
                competitive
                chain could be built at a cost of 12910.1 ETH / day if hashrate were purchased in the on-demand
                marketplace
                considered.</p>
            <p>
                This analysis seems to fit our bespoke intuitive expectations for price vs. revenue models in a
                competitive
                and efficient market.</p>
            <p>
                We now apply this validated intuition as a heuristic for ETC’s hashing cost.</p>
            <p>
                ETC’s block time is roughly the same as ETH’s (though slightly faster because of relatively greater
                Difficulty volatility), so ETC also produces 6400 blocks / day.</p>
            <p>
                ETC’s block reward is 2.56 ETC, so ETC inflates at least <code>2.56 * 6400 = 16384</code> ETC / day.</p>
            <p>
                If we assume that the revenue should roughly match the production cost in ETC as it seems to in ETH then
                we
                could expect a mining cost of 16384 ETC * 36 USD/ETC = 589_824 USD / day, or 24_576 USD / hr.</p>
